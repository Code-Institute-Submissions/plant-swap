## Introduction
*Plant Swap* was created for plant enthusiasts around the world who are looking to adopt new plants while making sure their unwanted plants go to a good home. 

At *Plant Swap* we truly believe in "One Man's Trash Is Another Man's Treasure". Why spend money on a new plant when you can simply swap instead?
